{{/*
Chart-specific helpers only. The naming, label and service-account helpers, the
shared manifests (Deployment, RBAC, NetworkPolicy, certificate, service, PDB,
ServiceMonitor, webhook configurations) and the "operator-library.chart.*" hooks
live in the operator-library library chart; the RBAC rules are generated into
_rbac-rules.tpl from the kubebuilder markers (make sync-helm-rbac). A chart
overrides a library hook by defining a template of the same name here.
